# Pokémon Web App

This project is an interactive web application that allows users to explore Pokémon using the PokeAPI. Users can search and view details of Pokémon, including their types, stats, evolutions, and more. The application uses JavaScript to fetch data from the API and display it in an attractive user interface.


This project was created as part of a workshop where students applied their knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the use of public APIs to build an interactive web application.

## Features

- View a list of Pokémon with pagination.
- Filters to display Pokémon by type.
- Show detailed information for each Pokémon, including height, weight, abilities, and stats.
